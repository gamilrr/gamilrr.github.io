When the acronym IoT(Internet of Things) started to spread everywhere as the new IT fashion around summer of 2010, everybody wanted to try their own tiny devices connected to Internet and show them to their coworkers and friends, but there was not a standard, nice and easy platform to implement an IoT device by everybody, especially for those software engineers whom didn’t have experience in electronic and the first OSI-layer protocols, but suddenly everything exploded.<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Very soon, the Industry look at this directly, pushed for Arduino, Raspberry Pi platforms and the likes, giants and new companies began to implement and improve the infrastructure to support IoT technologies, from SoC(System of Chip) with Ethernet and wireless modules built-in until the birth and upgrade of networking protocols in PAN(Personal Area Network) and WLAN scale such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, 6lowPAN, and others. Also, stated web frameworks started to provide APIs to support IoT communications protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, DDS, and other M2M implementations and most Cloud Services added its owns IoT solutions; in addition, Arduino gone out of hobbyist development and got in production life-cycle with a wide number of platforms and hardware architecture. Life became easier but still exciting.</p>
<p>Today you can buy as cheap as 4 dollars IoT device such as ESP8266 module and program it in Lua, Python, Go, Arduino and almost whatever syntax you want, plug it in any Arduino Board Kit and play with them by sending data to a free cloud service like ThingSpeak, AWS IoT and others; neither electronic-component issues or communications protocols details mattered any more.
